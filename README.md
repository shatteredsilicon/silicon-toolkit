# Silicon Toolkit
Silicon Toolkit is a collection of advanced command-line tools used by
Shattered Silicon (https://shatteredsilicon.net/) support staff to perform
a variety of MySQL and system tasks that are too difficult or complex
to perform manually.

These tools are ideal alternatives to private or "one-off" scripts because
they are professionally developed, formally tested, and fully documented.
They are also fully self-contained, so installation is quick and easy and
no libraries are installed.

Silicon Toolkit is developed and supported by Shattered Silicon.  For more
information and other free, open-source software developed by Shattered Silicon,
