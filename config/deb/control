Description: Advanced MySQL and system command-line tools
 Silicon Toolkit is a collection of advanced command-line tools used by
 Shattered Silicon (https://shatteredsilicon.net/) support staff to perform
 a variety of MySQL and system tasks that are too difficult or complex
 to perform manually.
 .
 These tools are ideal alternatives to private or "one-off" scripts because
 they are professionally developed, formally tested, and fully documented.
 They are also fully self-contained, so installation is quick and easy and
 no libraries are installed.
 .
 Silicon Toolkit is developed and supported by Shattered Silicon.  For more
